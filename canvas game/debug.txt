In this part I had so many error but I abled to fix them throgh the consoles. unfortuntly I couldn't put script in js folder, I don't know it refues to work with me so I included the orignal work in "Original files". I notice if I put my script before the body it won't work it should be included in the body and I don't know how to do that in saprated folder to do that. the main bugs I have is mostly spelling error and naming. overall I tried to be more creative.
